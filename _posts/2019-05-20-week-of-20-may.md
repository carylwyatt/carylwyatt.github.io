### 20 may

This week is going to be all about figuring out the alerts app/API in docker/php 5.5, then transferring it to 7.2. 

#### exploring the app/API

I started the day going one-by-one through the global functions. I didn't get very far before I realized the word "alerts" isn't even present in the functions file. I decided to switch gears and focus on the API files.

The API never adds the server/host parameter for the `gConnectDB` function, so it is defaulting to "localhost". As I learned last week, "localhost" doesn't work for the docker container. I thought I was being clever by trying to rename the docker mysql service "localhost" instead of "mysql," but it only caused connection errors (no surprise there). A good waste of a half hour, I'd say. Lesson learned!

Instead, I'll try updating the default parameter to "mysql". That seems to be working, but the API endpoint still isn't connecting, so it's back to the drawing board.
