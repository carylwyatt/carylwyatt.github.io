### 13 may

Monday! Fresh week without any mistakes in yet, right? Ha.

#### docker mariaDB data

I struggled this morning to get the data I managed to dump out of the `webapps_hours` database on Friday into the docker container, but I did it!

First, dumping the SQL:
* Doesn't matter where you are in the server, this command connects to the MySQL database and dumps the table you're asking for:
  * `mysqldump -u username -p --databases databasename > filename.sql`
* This ended up in my home drive on the server, so I FTP'd it to my local machine, straight into the directory with the `docker-compose` file in it
* To make that file available to the docker container, I had to mount a new volume in `docker-compose` under `mariadb` (that second volume is the new one):
  ```
  volumes:
    - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
    - .:/mnt/mydata
  ```

Then, importing the SQL:
* make sure docker is up
  * `docker-compose up -d`
* getchyoself in interactive shell mode
  * `docker exec -it [container-name_mariadb_1] bash`
* traverse to your mounted volume
  * `cd /mnt/mydata`
* import that database, yo
  * `mysql -u username -p < filename.sql`

I struggled forever because I kept trying to put this data into the database the docker container created, `testdb`. BUT the dump file is set up so it creates a new database. I only figure that out after trying forever to use `mysql -u username -p testdb < filename.sql` and nothing happening, so I finally opened the SQL file. The CREATE statement was right at the top, so, my bad. 

To enter the database, `mysql -u username -p webapps_hours`. Then `show tables;` to verify there's stuff in there. Boom!
