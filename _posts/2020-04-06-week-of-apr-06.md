### 07 apr

I'm going to start experimenting with building our headless wordpress with Vue! Before I go installing a bunch of stuff and forgetting what I did, I decided to fire up the ol' work log. It's always handy in cases like these!

### vue cli, app setup

The tutorials I followed for vue cli all used `npm install -g vue-cli` but I should've checked the latest documentation on that because that's deprecated! The latest version uses the new notation `npm install -g @vue/cli`. Of course when I tried to install the latest, I got an error about overwriting the old version of vue, so now I need to delete some stuff. The npm error tells me to run the install with --force to "overwrite files recklessly." :joy: Seeing as I've never written anything in vue or ever used vue-cli, I think I'll be okay overwriting it.

```
npm i -g @vue/cli --force
```

### hello world

Then I ran `vue create hello-world` and chose babel, eslint, and npm during installation. The build told me to `cd hello-world` and `npm run serve` so I did. It told me where my app is running (port 8081 since my local bitnami is currently running in 8080), and I opened the browser there. Hello world app is successfully running!
