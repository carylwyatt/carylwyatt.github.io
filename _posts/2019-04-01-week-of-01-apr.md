New week, new testing fails! 

Here are the tabs I left open from last week:

* [Stack overflow: Can unit testing be successfully added to an existing project?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3476054/can-unit-testing-be-successfully-added-into-an-existing-production-project-if-s)
* [Writing unit tests for existing JavaScript](https://rmurphey.com/blog/2014/07/13/unit-tests)
* [Comprehensive guide to unit testing in AngularJS](https://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/comprehensive-guide-to-unit-testing-in-angularjs)
  * There are many of these types out there, but this is the only one that goes step-by-step about the whys/hows of testing factories and other services that depend on factories
* [Angular ngMock `$inject` docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/function/angular.mock.inject)

I'll read some of that and see where it takes me. 

More reading, more youtubes. I watched some legacy codebase talks that sent me down the path of looking at end-to-end testing instead of unit testing. Since a legacy codebase has so much going on, unit testing can be very difficult, especially for figuring out where to start. Starting with E2E tests gives you test coverage of an app's behavior, so when you go back and start refactoring/adding unit tests, you can maintain that behavior without screwing things up too much. At least, that's the idea I'm getting with all this. 

SO. Even though I've spent a lot of time trying to set up jasmine/karma, I'm going to pivot to trying out cypress. I'll add a new branch to the repo and begin anew! If it turns to be too much of headache, then I'm not really sure what I'll do after that. But I also have a copy of Michael Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*, so maybe I'll have a better roadmap later this week. I guess we'll wait and see what happens!

Time to get Cypress.io set up. 

Setting up cypress was very easy! I got the hours app demo up and running basics tests very quickly, which was a pleasant surprise. Now... what to test?

After some additional youtube watching and article reading, this seems to be the consensus on E2E tests:

#### E2E workflow

1. Build user functions
  * list the features of the system and their interconnected components
  * list input data, action, and output data for each feature/function
  * identify relationships between functions
  * determine whether function can be reusable or independent
1. Build conditions based on user functions
  * build a set of conditions for each defined (above) user function
  * conditions include sequence of events, timing, data
  * examples: invalid UN/PW, PW strength checks, error message for invalid options, etc.
1. Build test scenario
  * at least one per user function
  * definitely more if there are multiple conditions per function/feature

I always have a hard time deciding where to start, and several articles suggested focusing on the most important tasks. What are the most important tasks of the hours app?

* listing hours for each library
* open/closing soon/closed/opening soon status listing
* calendar browsing

The *Legacy Code* book came yesterday! I'm going to spend a good amount of time today reading through it and taking notes. Yippee!
