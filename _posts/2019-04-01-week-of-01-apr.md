### 01 apr

New week, new testing fails! 

Here are the tabs I left open from last week:

* [Stack overflow: Can unit testing be successfully added to an existing project?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3476054/can-unit-testing-be-successfully-added-into-an-existing-production-project-if-s)
* [Writing unit tests for existing JavaScript](https://rmurphey.com/blog/2014/07/13/unit-tests)
* [Comprehensive guide to unit testing in AngularJS](https://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/comprehensive-guide-to-unit-testing-in-angularjs)
  * There are many of these types out there, but this is the only one that goes step-by-step about the whys/hows of testing factories and other services that depend on factories
* [Angular ngMock `$inject` docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/function/angular.mock.inject)

I'll read some of that and see where it takes me. 

More reading, more youtubes. I watched some legacy codebase talks that sent me down the path of looking at end-to-end testing instead of unit testing. Since a legacy codebase has so much going on, unit testing can be very difficult, especially for figuring out where to start. Starting with E2E tests gives you test coverage of an app's behavior, so when you go back and start refactoring/adding unit tests, you can maintain that behavior without screwing things up too much. At least, that's the idea I'm getting with all this. 

SO. Even though I've spent a lot of time trying to set up jasmine/karma, I'm going to pivot to trying out cypress. I'll add a new branch to the repo and begin anew! If it turns to be too much of headache, then I'm not really sure what I'll do after that. But I also have a copy of Michael Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*, so maybe I'll have a better roadmap later this week. I guess we'll wait and see what happens!
