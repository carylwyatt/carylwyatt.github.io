### 18 mar

Things got hectic at the end of Friday before spring break. Because I was hustlin' so hard, I didn't have time to update the log. Let's see if I can recap and update with today's fixes.

I think this whole thing can be boiled down to: 

- I'm still new 
- this was my first time pushing to the deploy repo 
- there is scant documentation on the codebase/git workflow

All of that added up to a bit of a storm when a request was made to **push to production on the Friday before spring break**. Thankfully, this was a pretty minor update, so it wasn't a huge deal that it didn't end up happening last week. Still, what I pushed to production broke the homepage, and even after fixing it last week and updating it today, I'm not sure *why* that happened. Here comes the post mortem.
