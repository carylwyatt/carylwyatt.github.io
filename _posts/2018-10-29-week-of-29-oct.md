### 31 oct

Happy Halloween! Time to figure out this spooky SD card. Maybe. Hopefully.

I reflashed Jonathan's SD card three times, and I keep getting the kernel panic error. Whatever I'm doing isn't working, so it's time to try something new.

Error: `Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,2)`

I might try to flash a different image onto Jonathan's card to check if it's **this** image or any image that's causing this error.

Did some [fdisk/gparted sleuthing](http://kbdatabase.org/article.php?id=64) and found that the problem is my image is from a 32GB SD card and the image I'm trying to flash is a full 29.8GB... Jonathan's card is only 8GB. So I need to figure out how to shrink my image??
