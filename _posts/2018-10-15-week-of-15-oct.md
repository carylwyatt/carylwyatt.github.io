### 15 oct

Back at it, y'all. If you recall, I left off in late September by flashing Jonathan's SD card. I just plugged it in the raspi and nothing happened. I plugged the raspi into the TV and found out that I'm getting a kernel panic error... which is my favorite. I'll reflash the SD card using the latest backup and hope it works this time.

Did this stuff:
- `sudo fdisk -l` to make sure I had my drives straight
- `sudo gparted` and it gave me a bunch of errors about having a partition outside the disk... which leads me to believe I really messed something up during the previous gparted/flash round
- used gparted to fix the disk... had to create a new partition table and everything
- once it was reformatted to one FAT32 partition, I quit gparted and `sudo etcher`
- chose `counter_backup.img` from the usb stick to flash onto Jonathan's SD card
