### 20 sep

It's here! It's finally time! I was hired with the understanding I'd eventually be helping with FOLIO implementation, and the time has arrived! I want to keep some notes for when I need to look back on what I did.

#### installation

Download and install VirtualBox

- `brew install vagrant`
- `mkdir folio-snapshot`
- `cd folio-snapshot`
- `vagrant init --minimal folio/snapshot` 
- `vagrant up`

Once vagrant is up, you can navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the login screen. HOWEVER you may not be able to log in (diku_admin/admin) for a while as okapi is out there trying to pull down the latest modules from docker.

Vagrant boxes: https://app.vagrantup.com/folio
Docker images: https://hub.docker.com/u/folioorg
