### 30 sep

First day back in the office. Missing my baby! :sob:

#### catching up

There were some inbox/todo items that I couldn't really work on from home, so that's what I'm focusing on today. 

I put in a ticket with ACS to update my ILLiad client since that happened while I was out. 

I also followed up on my ticket to OIT about accessing the ILLiad server from home, and they don't seem to want to help me with that. I asked OCLC if there was anything else I could do, and they suggested asking my home ISP to set me a static IP, which doesn't seem likely to happen. So. I guess I just won't work on ILLiad from home?
