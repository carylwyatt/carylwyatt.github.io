#### roots on MAMP

1. launch mamp
1. go to webstart page
1. go to tools > phpmyadmin
1. in the main window, click the databases tab
1. under "Create database" add a name for a new database (roots?)
1. download latest WP from wordpress.org/download and unzip
1. move that wordpress folder to where you want your wordpress install to live (on macs, use /Sites) and rename to new path name
1. if you haven't alreay done so, change mamp directory to where your folder is (MAMP > Preferences > Web Server > Document Root)
1. might also want to change your ports to 80/3306 so you don't have to do localhost:8888 
1. head to localhost, click the directory for your new WP isntall
1. run through WP install process: database name is whatever you named your database in step 5, username/password are both `root`, leave the last two alone; click run installation
1. on welcome page, create your login info... I like to keep this to the same as my other wordpress logins so I don't confused later
1. log in to new WP, should see the dashboard
1. clone `roots-ualib` repo into `wp-content/themes` directory 
1. INSTALL ALL THE THINGS from the Quick Start part of the theme wiki
  - `npm i -g grunt-cli bower`
  - `sudo npm i`
  - `bower install`
  - `grunt`
  - once it finishes building, `Ctrl+C` to stop watching
  - open `roots-ualib/wp-config.php` and add `define( 'WP_ENV', 'development' );` to the top under the initial comments
