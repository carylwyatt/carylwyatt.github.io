#### server/apache log fun

On Friday, Jennifer hooked me up with some info about our apache logs so I can see PHP errors in realtime. Imma drop that info here for future reference:

* ssh into dev/prod server
* `cd /var/log/apache2`
* `less <filename>` - quick view and scan a file or logfile
* `tail -f <filename>` - watch output to file (like a logfile in real time)

Haley fixed her code this morning, so the hours API is back up and functioning and I can continue with my angular directives/controllers/testing journey. Yay! :tada:

#### building a test angular app

I went over the [AngularJS fundamentals in 60 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM) video again today, but this time I actually followed along with the coding. Through this process I found out why my previous angular app wasn't working! There are some difference in the very early version of angular we use... surprise! This time, the app actually runs and has some dynamic behavior. 

After that, I decided to dive back into the hours app code. I kept getting my wires crossed, so I ended up taking notes/mind mapping the code. This was insanely helpful, so I'll need to remember that for the future. I'm hoping all these apps are structured in more-or-less the same method, so maybe after I figure this one out, the rest of them will be "easy." 

I realized today that our apps all use class-based directives. :flushed: After I've finished writing tests, one of my first refactors will be changing these class-restricted directives to attribute-restricted directives. 

Also came across [John Papa's Angular style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) which will prove to be very helpful in the coming weeks.

### 26 mar

Read a great article today (via twitter, of course): [Innovate this! Bullshit in academic libraries and what we can do about it](https://digital.library.ryerson.ca/islandora/object/RULA%3A7113)

Worked on review material via digital measures for quite some time this morning, as well.

I've been trying to figure out how exactly the app code ends up in the dev repo. For example, the hours app is its own repo: `hours_ui`. This app also technically lives in the `roots-ualib` repo, but it doesn't end up in the compiled build. So... where is that all happening? And how does it end up live? 

I learned pretty early on that all the stuff in the `vendor` folder (which, coincidentally, is the folder that doesn't end up in the compiled build) is all compiled into the `scripts_bower.js` file. As I was messing with the hours app as it exists in `roots`, I noticed the grunt build isn't affected by any changes made in that folder. Which led me to believe there must be some kind of connection between the `hours_ui` repo and the `roots` repo. The `hours_ui` repo has its own grunt build and development workflow... is the compile for the `hours_ui` build somehow connected to the `roots` repo through a github hook or something? Guess I'm going to have to make a small change and see how `grunt live-build` in `hours_ui` changes things or doesn't. :woman_shrugging:

Hokay, so. `hours_ui` is listed as a bower dependency, so it ends up getting pulled in/compiled during the grunt build (I tested: it does it for both default and live tasks). Any template/js changes in those apps end up in `/assets/js/scripts_bower.js`. List of our apps in the bower dependencies list: 

* `ualib-ui`
* `onesearch`
* `ualib-hours`
* `manage`
* `databases`
* `musicSearch`
* `ualib_staffdir`
* `ualib-softwareList`
* `ualib-news`
* `compfinder`

Today was an object lesson in the complexity of this codebase. Every time I think I finally have a grasp on it, there's yet another layer. I hope this is one of the last things that doesn't make sense, but that's probably wishful thinking, right?

Testing! I'm trying to figure out where to start with writing tests for the hours app. Looking through the angular docs, it looks like they recommend:

* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html): command line tool for spawning web server in the browser
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html): BDD frameworks
  * Karma is "test framework agnostic" so I could use mocha/chai if I want, but Jasmine seems pretty similar, so I might stick with it for now since Angular documentation has unit/e2e test examples for their API in Jasmine
* ngMocks: mocking for tests
* [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/): end-to-end testing framework built by angular
* [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed): an example angular project that includes tests; maybe follow this setup?

I think I'll start by cloning the angular-seed project and getting it set up to see how all the things run.

Also: since all these apps already use grunt/bower, I need to do some digging on how to add automatic testing to the Gruntfile. 

Get ready to break some stuff! :sweat_smile:
