### 25 mar

#### server/apache log fun

On Friday, Jennifer hooked me up with some info about our apache logs so I can see PHP errors in realtime. Imma drop that info here for future reference:

* ssh into dev/prod server
* `cd /var/log/apache2`
* `less <filename>` - quick view and scan a file or logfile
* `tail -f <filename>` - watch output to file (like a logfile in real time)

Haley fixed her code this morning, so the hours API is back up and functioning and I can continue with my angular directives/controllers/testing journey. Yay! :tada:

#### building a test angular app

I went over the [AngularJS fundamentals in 60 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM) video again today, but this time I actually followed along with the coding. Through this process I found out why my previous angular app wasn't working! There are some difference in the very early version of angular we use... surprise! This time, the app actually runs and has some dynamic behavior. 

After that, I decided to dive back into the hours app code. I kept getting my wires crossed, so I ended up taking notes/mind mapping the code. This was insanely helpful, so I'll need to remember that for the future. I'm hoping all these apps are structured in more-or-less the same method, so maybe after I figure this one out, the rest of them will be "easy." 

I realized today that our apps all use class-based directives. :flushed: After I've finished writing tests, one of my first refactors will be changing these class-restricted directives to attribute-restricted directives. 

Also came across [John Papa's Angular style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) which will prove to be very helpful in the coming weeks.
