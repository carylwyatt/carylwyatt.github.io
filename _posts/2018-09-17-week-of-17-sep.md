### recap

This is a continuation of an ongoing series of work logs following my journey to dockerize my people counter raspberry pi app. I feel like I'm almost done with it, but every day is a new discovery of things I didn't know I needed to do, followed by figuring out how to do those things. Follow along if you like, and feel free to go back through the annals of time:

### 17 sep

Continuing my quest to configure email on the pi. Since I plugged in the original SD card, it doesn't have any of the mail stuff I installed on the other SD card. I'm following the instructions from the raspberry pi forum post [No mail command with heirloom-mailx on Raspbian-Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=205603) then re-following the [sending email via gmail in linux](http://thelinuxtips.com/2011/09/19/sending-email-via-gmail-in-linux/) post and hoping for the best.

This approach worked as long as I use the command `mail` instead of `mailx`. Now to figure out how to configure the `unattended-upgrades` email...

There are many layers to this email business. I thought `mailx` was a program, but turns out it's just a command line tool to pass mail to your Mail Transfer Agent (sendmail, postfix, etc.). I ended up following the advice in the "No mail command..." post linked above and symlinked the commands `mail` and `mailx` to `heirloom-mailx`. I ran a test using both `mail` and `mailx` and they both sent email, so I'm going to say I'm good. Now I need to swap out the SD cards and update the other card and run the `unattended-upgrades` dry run to make sure it's sending the update email.
