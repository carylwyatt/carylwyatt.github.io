### recap

This is a continuation of an ongoing series of work logs following my journey to dockerize my people counter raspberry pi app. I feel like I'm almost done with it, but every day is a new discovery of things I didn't know I needed to do, followed by figuring out how to do those things. Follow along if you like, and feel free to go back through the annals of time:
