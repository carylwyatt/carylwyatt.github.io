### recap

This is a continuation of an ongoing series of work logs following my journey to dockerize my people counter raspberry pi app. I feel like I'm almost done with it, but every day is a new discovery of things I didn't know I needed to do, followed by figuring out how to do those things. Follow along if you like, and feel free to go back through the annals of time:

### 24 sep

It's been a weird kind of Monday. I just started reading up on the `--env-file` flag and it's already 6:40pm, so this is probably all that will happen tonight.

Just found out that `.env` files only work with Docker compose. Which I don't want to add to my repertoire right now. So it looks like we'll be going with `-e` commands during `docker run`. *sigh*
