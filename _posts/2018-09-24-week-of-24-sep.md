### recap

This is a continuation of an ongoing series of work logs following my journey to dockerize my people counter raspberry pi app. I feel like I'm almost done with it, but every day is a new discovery of things I didn't know I needed to do, followed by figuring out how to do those things. Follow along if you like, and feel free to go back through the annals of time:

### 24 sep

It's been a weird kind of Monday. I just started reading up on the `--env-file` flag and it's already 6:40pm, so this is probably all that will happen tonight.

Just found out that `.env` files only work with Docker compose. Which I don't want to add to my repertoire right now. So it looks like we'll be going with `-e` commands during `docker run`. *sigh*

### 25 sep

Today will be reimaging the SD card and seeing what happens when I pull down the current docker image. 

Following the "instructions" I wrote starting [15 august](http://carylwyatt.github.io/blog/2018/08/13/week-of-13-august):
  - `sudo gparted`
  - unmount and delete all partitions on sd card except one
  - reformat (by selecting "new" and using the format dropdown) to FAT32
  - `sudo etcher`
  - select `raspbian_backup.img`, select SD card as destination
  - FLASH

What I suspect will need to happen:
  - I believe I did not erase all the docker images from this latest backup, so I'll need to wipe the slate clean and reimage in order to really test pulling down the docker image
  - This is indeed the case, so:
    - Remove all containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
    - Remove all images: `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`

I'll need to do this again after testing the docker pull!

Had a weird error when I tried to run the container: `error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint on network bridge`. After a reboot, I had no problem.

The docker image is not updated. So I need to push the new docker image with the updated Dockerfile and extra javascript file. Then try this all again. 

Made the necessary updates, then rebuilt the docker image and pushed to docker hub:
  - from the most recent directory
  - `docker build carylwyatt/raspberrypi-people-counter .`
  - double checked the image was running correctly with the usual run statement
  - `docker push carylwyatt/raspberrypi-people-counter`
  - success!

Just tested pulling and running the image, and it's working! Now I just need to update the image so the `POST_PATH` variable doesn't default to my API. Maybe there's a way to have the error message reflect that it needs an updated variable?
