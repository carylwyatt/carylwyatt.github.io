### 15 apr

I'm hoping to wrap up accessibility audits and reports in the next few days so I can get back to testing. I'd also like to be finished with cypress testing of that app this week so I can get into integration/unit tests and actual changes. At some point this week, I also need to read up on DSpace and see what that's all about. How much of that will I actually accomplish? Only time will tell.
