title: "google calendar hours plugin"

This plugin takes information from a single Google calendar and displays it in a table. [Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis Library's website](http://library.ivytech.edu/indianapolis) (via Springshare's LibGuides CMS) uses this tool to display "Today's Hours" for three library locations on the homepage. 

### Screenshot
This is how it's displayed on our website, but you can style however you like.

### More details
You will need access to the settings of the Google Calendar you want to get data from. You will also need to access the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/). 
## Calendar setup
This script reads specific data points from the calendar's JSON data. If you don't want to fiddle with the JS, you'll have to set up your calendar and events exactly like mine. Feel free to do things your own way, but you'll have to edit the code. 

### Calendar Settings
Access permissions: check **make available to public** box

### Events

- Summary can be whatever will make it easy for you to read
- Description is what will actually show up on the calendar
	- if the description is left **blank**, the event won't show up at all
- If you want the open and close times to show up, make sure you enter them into the event
- If you are closed, don't enter a start/end time
	- instead check the "**all-day event**" box for the event
	- this will cause the script to list "**closed**" on the hours widget

## Code
### HTML
{:.code-notes}

- Lines 1-2 load the required JS libraries; this can go in your header, but if you're using LibGuides, just drop this whole HTML section into the Source section of a rich text box
- Lines 4-8 are necessary, the rest are window dressing

### CSS

### JavaScript/jQuery
#### Notes for implementation

{:.code-notes}

- Line 16: You'll find your calendar address in the settings of the google calendar. It looks like an email address and follows the phrase **Calendar ID**.
- Line 17: The API key is supplied by the Google Developers Console API Manager. You will need to create a new credential for this project, and this is free to do. See [Creating a Google API Key](https://docs.simplecalendar.io/google-api-key/) for step-by-step instructions.
