### 04 mar

Lots happening today. Knocked out the first half of new employee orientation, and I'm still debating if I'll go back tomorrow for the benefits session since I've already enrolled in everything. Maybe there's something else to glean there?

#### bash script, MD > RTF

When I got back to the office, I picked up where I left off with trying to set up a command line utility for converting markdown files to rich text format. I found some promising leads, but nothing was as helpful as this post on [pandoc, textutility, and pbcopy from ostricher](https://www.ostricher.com/2015/08/from-markdown-to-pastable-formatted-text-in-os-x-terminal/). Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to add a find and replace action to take care of some weird encoding issue with apostrophes. To see the final script I ended up crafting, take a look at [my dotfiles > `~/.bash_profile`](https://github.com/carylwyatt/dotfiles). 

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, overview/setup

Now I'm working my way through the [FOLIO dev curriculum](https://dev.folio.org/tutorials/curriculum/overview/). I installed a bunch of stuff to my new work machine:
  - Java (JDK 11)
  - Maven (apache) 3.6
  - yarn 1.13
  - curl
  - VirtualBox 6
  - Vagrant 2.2.4

I followed all the directions in the curriculum overview for setting up a new directory and starting up vagrant/setting ROOT. 

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, part 1

Followed the instructions for building Okapi. I saw that the next step is to explore the API gateway, so I'm taking a little detour to google/youtube in an attempt to grasp the concept of API gateway as a microservice design pattern. This is all greek to me, so hopefully a few videos and articles will help shed some light on this topic.

[Why should you use an API Gateway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmFB0YSHri8) was the best video I found. Much simpler than lots of the conference talks out there.

### 05 mar

Now that I have a rudimentary understanding of API gateways and why they're a good thing for large applications, I can move my way through the first chapter. I forgot to ssh into vagrant when I opened a new terminal tab, so the curl http request wasn't working correctly. Must remember to:
```
cd folio-curriculum
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
cd folio-tutorial-working-files
export FOLIO_ROOT=`pwd`
```

The rest of chapter 1 was pretty self-explanatory.

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, part 2

I have no idea what's going on, but I'm following the instructions and getting the correct results, so let's hope this will all amount to understanding at some point! :crossed_fingers:

### 06 mar

Started the day reading [this tweet about bias in discovery system algorithm bias](https://twitter.com/LibSkrat/status/1103035379324719104) and following up with reading/youtubes:

- Matthew Reidsma's [Turning off Summon's Topic Explorer sidebar](https://matthew.reidsrow.com/worknotes/214)
- Which led me to his code4lib talk [Auditing Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFQOOVtFaco&feature=youtu.be&t=1h27m33s)
- Which reminded me that I seriously need to read Safiya Noble's [Algorithms of Oppression](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Oppression-Search-Engines-Reinforce/dp/1479837245)
- And left me with this great quote:
> Technology is a branch of moral philosophy, not a science. -Paul Goodman, 1969, *Can Technology Be Humane?*

#### adding renovation update box to website

I figured I'd spend the rest of the day working through the FOLIO developer curriculum, but we were assigned a new project! I ended up spending A LOT of time wandering blindly through the wordpress theme trying to figure out how the angular files interacted with each other. Simply *finding*  the angular files was tricky... none of the directories/filenames seem to be following any kind of angular naming conventions.

There is quite a bit of documentation on how to get the wordpress theme up and running on a local machine, but there is just **nothing** on how all the angular stuff works. I'm baffled by this. It's now my goal to write some documentation for this monster once I figure it all out. Hopefully my notes here as I go along will be enough to help me piece some stuff together. Since I don't really understand the code base, I'm going to be writing unit tests to figure it all out. I may not have the time to test everything, but writing tests for the pieces I end up working with will be *extremely* helpful in the long run. Can you believe there are **zero** tests for this site? I can't.

### 07 mar

I finished up yesterday after having finally figured out where/how to update the homepage template. For whatever reason, the Gruntfile does a bunch of weird stuff I can't quite decipher yet, and it took me a minute to figure out where everything was compiling. Then when I found that my HTML was indeed being compiled into a JS file, I had to open the source code on my local wordpress build just to realize that caching was in full effect and my code wasn't loading. After a hard refresh, everything was cool, but it took a long time for me to figure out what exactly the issue was. Hopefully this record will help remind me down the road in case it comes up again.

What needs to go down today:
- figure out why the wordpress API endpoint/JSON data wants the user logged in
- read up on the angular $http module and get that data loading
- write a new module/controller for the new reno box
- ???

#### wordpress API

It seems like there used to be a [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/#description) that had to be enabled, but the API stuff was merged into wordpress core in May 2018, so that isn't necessary any longer. This left me sifting through the [REST API handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). The section on [retrieving a post](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/posts/#retrieve-a-post) seems pretty straightforward, and this is basically what I did when I called the API and got the "not logged in" message. 

There's a whole page in the handbook on [authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication). It seems we might need to take this route to use the API from our homepage. Our homepage is served on our wordpress site, but it isn't wordpress (at least, I don't think it is). I've tried a bunch of stuff to get around authenticating because it looks somewhat painful, but I think I need to set up the request header and API settings in the enqueues... yay. Fun for tomorrow! 

I finally got to deploy the meeting minder/timetables app today! Woo! I think it needs some tinkering for usability purposes, but it already looks much better. :thumbs_up:
