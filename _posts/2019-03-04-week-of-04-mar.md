### 04 mar

Lots happening today. Knocked out the first half of new employee orientation, and I'm still debating if I'll go back tomorrow for the benefits session since I've already enrolled in everything. Maybe there's something else to glean there?

#### bash script, MD > RTF

When I got back to the office, I picked up where I left off with trying to set up a command line utility for converting markdown files to rich text format. I found some promising leads, but nothing was as helpful as this post on [pandoc, textutility, and pbcopy from ostricher](https://www.ostricher.com/2015/08/from-markdown-to-pastable-formatted-text-in-os-x-terminal/). Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to add a find and replace action to take care of some weird encoding issue with apostrophes. To see the final script I ended up crafting, take a look at [my dotfiles > `~/.bash_profile`](https://github.com/carylwyatt/dotfiles). 

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, overview/setup

Now I'm working my way through the [FOLIO dev curriculum](https://dev.folio.org/tutorials/curriculum/overview/). I installed a bunch of stuff to my new work machine:
  - Java (JDK 11)
  - Maven (apache) 3.6
  - yarn 1.13
  - curl
  - VirtualBox 6
  - Vagrant 2.2.4

I followed all the directions in the curriculum overview for setting up a new directory and starting up vagrant/setting ROOT. 

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, part 1

Followed the instructions for building Okapi. I saw that the next step is to explore the API gateway, so I'm taking a little detour to google/youtube in an attempt to grasp the concept of API gateway as a microservice design pattern. This is all greek to me, so hopefully a few videos and articles will help shed some light on this topic.

[Why should you use an API Gateway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmFB0YSHri8) was the best video I found. Much simpler than lots of the conference talks out there.

### 05 mar

Now that I have a rudimentary understanding of API gateways and why they're a good thing for large applications, I can move my way through the first chapter. I forgot to ssh into vagrant when I opened a new terminal tab, so the curl http request wasn't working correctly. Must remember to:
```
cd folio-curriculum
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
cd folio-tutorial-working-files
export FOLIO_ROOT=`pwd`
```

The rest of chapter 1 was pretty self-explanatory.

#### FOLIO dev curriculum, part 2

I have no idea what's going on, but I'm following the instructions and getting the correct results, so let's hope this will all amount to understanding at some point! :crossed_fingers:

### 06 mar

Started the day reading [this tweet about bias in discovery system algorithm bias](https://twitter.com/LibSkrat/status/1103035379324719104) and following up with reading/youtubes:

- Matthew Reidsma's [Turning off Summon's Topic Explorer sidebar](https://matthew.reidsrow.com/worknotes/214)
- Which led me to his code4lib talk [Auditing Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFQOOVtFaco&feature=youtu.be&t=1h27m33s)
- Which reminded me that I seriously need to read Safiya Noble's [Algorithms of Oppression](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Oppression-Search-Engines-Reinforce/dp/1479837245)
- And left me with this great quote:
> Technology is a branch of moral philosophy, not a science. -Paul Goodman, 1969, *Can Technology Be Humane?*

Now on to continuing my FOLIO journey.
