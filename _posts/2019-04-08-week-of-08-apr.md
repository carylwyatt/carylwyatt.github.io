### 08 apr

Starting this week off strong with a meeting with Tom. Talked all about the future of the website (very vaguely, but big picture), all the accessibility issues that need fixing by next month, and wider accessibility issues that will need to updated as we continue adding functionality to other systems in our sphere. 

Back to testing!
