### 08 apr

Starting this week off strong with a meeting with Tom. Talked all about the future of the website (very vaguely, but big picture), all the accessibility issues that need fixing by next month, and wider accessibility issues that will need to updated as we continue adding functionality to other systems in our sphere. 

Back to testing! 

### 12 apr

Fast forward to Friday.

I implemented lots of cypress tests Monday/Tuesday, but had to switch gears to a11y of libguides on Wednesday. I didn't realize we have **394 libguides**. After auditing them, there is an outrageous amount of duplication of content in there. I can't believe the amount of content debt going on... that's going to have to be addressed at some point, because it's simply ridiculous.

The good news is that most of the accessibility issues are contained to mapped content, so fixing them in one place should fix lots of guides all at once. 

I hope to go back to testing and start working on DSpace stuff next week. We'll see!
