### 17 jun

I'm quite exhausted from my weekend in Indiana, but this ish has to get going. If I don't figure out this stupid `userGroupsAdmin` nonsense in the next few days, I'm going to pull my hair out.

Right off the bat, I decided to take a look at what the live `/manage-user-groups` route has going on in the console since I'm already logged out after the weekend. It gave me a `401 (Unauthorized)` for the `/users/me` endpoint, which is not surprising. But it doesn't match the error in the docker build: `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. Also, the live site still generated a `ualibweb.Token` that is showing up in `window.localStorage` even though no one is logged in. Oddly, it does have the `WP_DATA_USER_118` in localStorage, too, so maybe that's a cookie/cache situation?

No matter who I log in as in the docker site, the localStorage remains `WP_DATA_USER_1`. I've logged in as me, as Boris, and Andrew... no difference. I wonder how I can change that? I've tried deleting cookies, hard reloading the cache... nothing. As Andrew, it should have me listed as `WP_DATA_USER_11`, but nope. Then again, I did well and truly screw something up when I imported this user table and erased my original admin account. I might need to just reinstall wordpress and add the `wp_users` and `wp_usermeta` tables after instead of completely wiping.

I reinstalled wordpress using the database prefix `wp2_` in the `wp-config.php` file. Then I added Andrew as a user to the new install. Still getting the same weird localStorage nonsense and ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in the console about `/users/me`... so it wasn't the messed up users table that was causing the issue in the other one. The problem there was that I couldn't make myself an administrator once I deleted my old admin account, so I couldn't get to the backend. :joy:

Back to square one, I guess. 

Next plan: copy all WP files directly from live server and export all WP data, put that stuff in a new docker container and see what happens. I'm very tired of building this thing, but maybe if I'm running the production version, there will be some setting that switches on that I'm missing?? Let's hope.

I'm in the middle of testing the docker build on my laptop (where I plan on working on the 1-1 build of the live site), when I stumbled up on a new mystery: even though I added Andrew as a user, the `/users` endpoint still only lists me as a user. Where is Andrew?? ...after a Google, it seems this is on purpose. If a user hasn't published any posts, they are left out of the users endpoint.

Then I tried to go to my specific user ID endpoint: `/users/1` and got a WP error page. Here's the log:

The `sGP/functions.php` weren't loading, which is what was causing my WebApps admin icon disappearance. It's back now and so is the user ID endpoint, but I'm still not setting the `ualibweb.Token` in localStorage. What's WEIRD though, is that my `/users/1` endpoint has a token set. Like, the object has a key called "token". How?! Where is that being injected? Why? And what does it do?

I'm willing to fall down that rabbit hole, and honestly, I probably should. Soon.

BUT. I also starting going through the wordpress `functions.php` and found a bunch of fascinating WP API stuff. I'd rather look into that right now.

On line 51, the whole rest API thing gets kicked off with a call a function from `sGP/functions.php`. THIS IS WHERE THE TOKEN IS BEING CREATED. Big news. 

There's then a function that checks if a user is logged in when they try to access the rest API. I'm a little confused by how this function actually works, because if all it's doing is checking for logged-in status, then why does my WP install think I'm not logged in? I definitely am. 

But it's the NEXT function that is the most interesting to me: for whatever reason, it's rewriting the endpoint `/users/$id` to `/users/me`. Why?! It also takes the token created from that first function and adds it to the endpoint. Like... these are clearly the functions I need to be focusing on. 

TODOs:
- Re-examine the `gGetUserData` global function
- Debug why that `rest_authentication_errors` hook thinks I'm not logged in
- Attempt to understand why `/users/me` was remapped... I'm pretty sure it's a custom endpoint

#### gGetUserData

Just had an "excuse me, WHAT" moment in my office. I've been echoing/var_dumping variables/functions from this `sGP/functions` file, and decided to just dump what `gGetUserData($userData)` outputs. On Andrew's login, it's returning:
```
array(3) { ["group"]=> int(0) ["ip"]=> string(10) "172.30.0.1" ["login"]=> NULL }
```

Which I *just* var_dumped from a different function `gGetUserGroupWP` his group should return 2047. 0?!? And login should be `amparker8` not NULL. So something in that function is busted. Database connection? 

Whyyyy does this function set the user group to 0 right off the bat? I've been var_dumping all up and down this function, and I can see no good reason to do that. How is this working in production?!

Alright. These two function files are wrapped up in each other. Imma need to print them out to see how everything connects. It looks like `$userData` (which is fed into a few different functions) is created in the wp `functions.php` file, but then *used* in the `sGP/functions.php` file. But *only* when the API is involved? Which seems odd. 

These functions are doing what they say they do (I mean, I assume almost all of them are and I just don't understand what that means yet): `createToken` in wp functions that creates a token for the rest_api_init later in the file is, indeed, creating a token. Even my `/users/1` JSON shows the token it created for me. So why is that token not being saved to localStorage for the headers? And why doesn't the `/users/me` path think I'm logged in? I checked that `preg_match` and it's returning 1, which means the API route found a match. 

Also: The routes don't think andrew's username exists. I tried `/users/11`, `/users?slug=amparker8`, `/users?nickname=amparker8` and nothing. Is the database not connecting correctly? Problem solved: I created a post under Andrew's name. Surprise, surprise, he's showing up in the JSON data now. So so strange.

Back to my new dilemma: If the `$userData` info is faulty, and then that data is being turned into a token that is then encoded, is it any wonder that the Authentication is failing? I still don't understand *why* the headers aren't being set... there's a token after all, shouldn't it use it even if it's not right?

Today was one of those days where I made **a ton** of progress but it does not look or feel like it. Hopefully I will wrap this up tomorrow. If not, I'm not sure what I'll do.

### 18 jun

It's 10:40, which means I've been hacking away for about 90 minutes. After talking to Scott this morning about how weird it is that I'm getting `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` in the console instead of a 401 or similar, he agreed that it's weird and I should look into that. So I googled.

Yesterday, I thought it was a problem with the endpoint `users/me`, so I started by changing that to just `users`, but the problem persisted. It didn't matter which API endpoint I tried to access, it wasn't having it, and kept giving me the same error. So something else was going down. When I looked at the console error, it suggested the problem was occurring at the function that sends the XHR request `xhr.send(post || null)`, so something deeper is going on here.

Googling the error message lead me to believe this might be a CORS issue, but then I chatted Scott about it and he thinks its SSL (a google confirmed this is probably the case):

![chat with scott about http vs https error](https://github.com/carylwyatt/carylwyatt.github.io/blob/master/img/ssl.png?raw=true)

Boooooo. So now I get to figure out how to add an SSL certificate to my docker container? Or localhost? WHYYYYY :weary:

Turns out, yes. This is definitely an issue. Let's Encrypt has an [entire page about how/why this is a thing](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/). Looks like I'll be generating a certificate for myself so my localhost can be served over secure HTTP. Lord almighty.

Hokay, so. Steps I followed (for future me):

- Used `docker-compose exec website bash` to drop me into my docker environment
- Did the command Let's Encrpyt suggested in that article above to generate localhost SSL keys/certs: 
```
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```
- Made new directory in `/etc/apache2`: `ssl`
- Copied new localhost key/cert to the ssl directory
  - `cd /etc/apache2/ssl`
  - `cp /var/www/html/localhost.crt .`
  - `cp /var/www/html/localhost.key .`
- Update 000-default.conf with new virtual host info
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/"
  ServerName localhost
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertifcateFile "/etc/apache2/ssl/localhost.crt"
  SSLCertifcateKeyFile "/etc/apache2/ssl/localhost.key"
</VirtualHost>
```

Had to rebuild the docker build: `docker-compose up --build` because of a typo in the apache config file, but it seems like everything is in the right place because it built!

Went to localhost, and got a 'Bad Request' error, which makes sense. I was trying to access at http site: "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand. Reason: You're speaking plain HTTP to an SSL-enabled server port. Instead use the HTTPS scheme to access this URL, please. Apahce/2.4.25 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 443."

I'm down with most of this message, since I was indeed trying to access it via HTTP. Buuuut what's this port 443 business about? I'm exposing port 80.

I tried adding `EXPOSE 443` to my Dockerfile and `-443:443` to the ports list in `docker-compose.yml`. Went to https://localhost and now I'm getting "This site can't provide a secure connection, localhost sent an invalid response. ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR" so I'm assuming I set something up wrong.

Thanks to a very helpful stack overflow, it turns out I didn't know that http is served in port 80 but https in served in port 443. Changed that in my 000-default.conf, Dockerfile, and docker-compose and TADA! 

**IT'S LOADING AND SO IS THE MANAGEMENT APP!!** :tada::tada::sob::grin:
