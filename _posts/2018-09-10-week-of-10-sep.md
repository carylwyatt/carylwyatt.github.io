### 10 sep

I FIGURED IT OUT, Y'ALL.

Turns out, I needed to use `ENTRYPOINT [ "npm", "start" ]` instead of `CMD [ "npm", "start" ]`. Now when I build the image and run it, it creates a new board, initializes a REPL, calibrates the sensor, and starts counting **without closing the board.**  It's a true miracle. 

So tomorrow:
- update github repo
- update README
- push update to Docker
- pull new Docker image to new SD card
