### 12 sep

Hieee! :wave: I had a baby! :baby: And she's perfect. :revolving_hearts: But now I'm back at work... from home. :woman_technologist::house:

I decided to keep it light last week and not worry about keeping a log, but things are starting to ramp up this week, and I'm going to need to remember decisions that are being made and things I try that work/don't work. That's what this work log is all about!

#### intranet

I somehow didn't have MAMP installed on this laptop?? I guess I always did wordpress stuff in docker. :woman_shrugging: To work on the intranet theme, I definitely need a server, so I downloaded MAMP, installed wordpress (how do I always forget to create the database before running the install?), downloaded the theme files from the dev server, installed the theme files, exported the content/media from the `appsdev` site, and imported it to my local version. Whew! :sweat_smile:

The items left as "to-do" in my asana are as follows:
- homepage
- custom post type: group posts
- custom post type: meeting minutes
- test user groups/permissions plugin

I think I should probably re-familiarize myself with the "flow" of the current intranet so I can get these custom post types working correctly. IIRC, there's such a mish-mash of post types in the intranet that it was hard to figure out what needed to be ported over. But I know the post types are important for the groups... I just wonder if there's a reason there are so many?

#### tickets

I went to the doctor (for the last time til next year!!) and when I came back, I had several tickets assigned to me. :laughing:

I transferred Donald's guide/assets to Jacob. I hope Steven can add Jacob to GA, because I looked at it, and I'm not sure what Jacob needs access to...

I was given the ticket about the weird icon PNG issue in the computer software app. I have an idea of what's going on with this, but I'll get to it tomorrow.

#### dspace

Another ticket is more of a continuation of a ticket I completed last week. I need to add a college and several communities to our IR homepage accordion. I'm going to put the instructions I wrote up last week here in my log.

##### updating colleges and communities

If you’re adding a community/college, all that’s necessary is to add the string to the appropriate array. For example, I just added “Department of Philosophy” to the “College of Arts & Sciences” array of departments. If that college/community doesn’t exist, you’ll get `undefined` on the page instead of name of the community/link. 

Edit the live file for immediate changes: `/srv/dspace/webapps/xmlui/themes/Mirage/lib/js/CuvtomJS.js`

Copy those changes to the `/srv/dspace-source/dspace/modules/xmlui/src/main/webapp/themes/Mirage/lib/js/CustomJS.js` file Drew lists above to make sure the latest changes you’ve made don’t get overwritten during a recompile. 

This editing the live file without needing to recompile works because it’s a javascript file that’s being loaded via the HTML `<script src=”…”></script>` and pulling straight from the server.
