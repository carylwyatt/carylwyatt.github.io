### 12 sep

Hieee! :wave: I had a baby! :baby: And she's perfect. :revolving_hearts: But now I'm back at work... from home. :woman_technologist::house:

I decided to keep it light last week and not worry about keeping a log, but things are starting to ramp up this week, and I'm going to need to remember decisions that are being made and things I try that work/don't work. That's what this work log is all about!
