I'm not against blogging. I'm just no good at it, really. Every time I start a blog, I have the best of intentions. Then real life gets in the way, or I run out of ideas for posts, and I eventually forget about the blog and it sits around for some sad person to find and wonder, "Why did she stop posting?" 

I would like to start a blog just to have a place to put my work stuff. I'm a developer librarian. What that means is I'm not a great developer and I'm not a great librarian, but somehow I'm pretty good at figuring out the important parts of both jobs. The developer part of the situation needs a space on the web, and what better home than a blog, amirite? 

I'm taking the advice of a blog I read the other day and just starting with 100 words. I think I can handle that. 100 words a week is a pretty good goal (for now). Stick around. I just might have something to write one of these days!
