### 20 feb 

First week at my new gig! There's a lot to learn, but I'm pretty excited! 

I wanted to make sure to track my learning journey, as I've done before. It looks like I'll be spending a lot of time getting up to speed on Angular 1.x, Wordpress, Apache, and some other things. I spent a good chunk of time today setting up my new mac, and that was very exciting since I've never had one for work before. Eee! I'm keeping vim for now, and hopefully I'll be a vim ninja by the end of the month. Anyway, here are the links for things I've been reading/watching so far:
