### 10 jun

New week! Gonna be a short one since I'm taking Friday off for Shelley's wedding! :tada:

The plan for the week is to get the apps I tested last week into a docker container with wordpress and see what happens. In theory, this shouldn't be a problem. I have a working wordpress docker container and a working docker container with the apps... now to get them to work together? Or create a new hybrid version? I found the WP database in adminer (`wordpress-www`)... I wonder how much of this I need to make the whole thing work in docker? Maybe I should start with the dev site data?
