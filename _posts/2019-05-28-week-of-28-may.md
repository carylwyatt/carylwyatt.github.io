### 28 may

Today was all about setting up a php analysis tool. Since I really struggled to get PHP 7.2 installed locally last week, I decided yet another docker container was the way to go. (After more googling today, it turns out PHP 7.2 and macOS Mojave don't really get along... :woman_shrugging:)

I followed the installation/config instructions and added all that stuff to my Dockerfile as I was going along. In the end, I did get phan set up correctly, as the phan tests were passing. However, I could never get it to analyze anything... there is some kind of fatal PHP error in one of the dependencies, and I don't know how to fix it.

I decided to pivot and try out the second tool I came across (has fewer stars on github but is still actively updated), PHPStan. I decided to try pulling down the official docker container and running it as a bash script against the superGlobalPHP directory, but it kept giving me errors that it couldn't find functions... in the functions.php file. So I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong with that one, either. 

The documentation on both of these projects is alright, but for someone who is not familiar with PHP, some of it is difficult to grasp. I'm going to keep trying on the phan container tomorrow... and I might need to start over with a clean dockerfile and install everything from command line inside the container just to double check I didn't screw things up via Dockerfile. I've been known to overcomplicate things, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case. Plus, I definitely learned a lot by setting things up the first time, and I added and deleted files/repos so many times that it's very possible I messed something up during setup. So a clean container is probably my best bet.
