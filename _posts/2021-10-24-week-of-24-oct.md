### 24 oct

Since we're getting ready to deploy our new headless CMS, I thought it might be a good idea to see what the latest and greatest devops options are for Wordpress these days. I went down a whoooole rabbit hole of videos from WP Campus conferences. Lots of colleges/universities use WP for their websites, and it doesn't make sense to totally reinvent the wheel if someone out there is doing it already and it works. For posterity, here are the recordings I watched, and maybe we can get around to implementing some CI/CD for our CMS at some point in the future.

- [Nobody puts WordPress in a container: Docker, GitLab, and continuous integration](https://2018.wpcampus.org/schedule/nobody-puts-wordpress-in-a-container/#video)
- [Composing continuously](https://2019.wpcampus.org/schedule/composing-continuously/)
- [A recipe for success: Kubernetes in higher education](https://2018.wpcampus.org/schedule/kubernetes-in-higher-education/)

And for good measure, a blog post on using composer for premium/paid plugins (although I don't think we're using any of these anymore): [How We Improved Composer Support For Our Premium Plugins Again](https://deliciousbrains.com/improved-authentication-composer-support/)
