### 01 jul 

Sleepy Monday, but time to get back on that grind.

The items on my to-do list are not necessarily related, so I think I'll spend the morning working on this docker version control issue, then pivot to the intranet stuff after lunch. I'm still waiting to hear about the outcome of the forms issue before I spend any more time debugging that app (in case we decide to scrap it entirely).

#### vc'ing that docker container

Where I left off: I thought I'd wiped the git configuration of the roots theme repo before pushing it up to github, but it ended up as a submodule anyway. 

I'm going to try:
- pushing the changes I've currently made to theme up to the `roots-ualib` repo as a new branch
- creating a new docker/wordpress container 
- adding that theme as a submodule, pulling directly from that branch/commit

We'll see what happens!

I think I did it! Took a few tries, but here's what worked:

- Copied the `wp-docker-apps` directory to `docker-roots-app`
- Deleted the `roots-ualib` theme directory
- Did an `rm -rf .git` at the root to get rid of all version history
- Created new private github repo
- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "first commit"`
- `git remote add origin <url>`
- `git push -u origin master`
- Copied url of `roots-ualib` repo
- `cd app/wp-content/themes/`
- `git submodule add -b docker https://github.com/ualibweb/roots-ualib.git`
- cd up to the top of the directory, `cat .gitmodules` to make sure it's there
- cd to `/themes/roots-ualib` and see it's already checked out to `docker` branch

Success???

The good news: the submodule is working. The bad news: now I have to figure out how to run the grunt build and pull in the vendor libraries without overwriting all the filepath changes I made. Maybe a challenge for another day?

I've spent a good while trying to undo the dumb-dumb mistake I made in this new docker container. I'm glad I'm trying this out in a test repo and not using the repo/container with my actual stuff in it! Learned a lot about `git reflog` and `git reset`, but I can't figure out how to unstage the changes I made in my submodule without deleting it and starting again. Which might be a good idea? That didn't work either for some reason. Getting the error "wp-content/themes/root-ualib already exists in the index". Tried some `git rm --cached roots-ualib` and removing of git submodules and stuff, but it ain't working. So I'mma delete the whole thing and pull it down fresh. BOOOOO 

Lesson learned: don't try to set the WP theme to roots until you've run the grunt build. You're gonna have a bad time.

All in all, a successful day with the version control and git setups. I also did some ticket work/troubleshooting on LibCal, so it was sort of in and out of learning this stuff and handling that.
