### 29 jul 

This week:
- intranet-- all day, e'rry day
- which hopefully includes testing the LDAP plugin, finally
- finish up instruction forms

*At the end of Friday, I was frantically trying to put my thoughts down on paper about the `phpmailer` error I was running into. Here's what I had.*

PHP fatal error when trying to export CSV: `phpmailerException` already declared
- Why is this even being invoked?
- No sign of php mailer or any other mail settings in data export module
- This file isn't even in the same directory as the intranet! It's in `www`
- Okay, so `phpmailer` is included in incident report...
- Monday: figure out a way to temporarily delete or disable the incident report or `phpmailer` stuff and see what happens

I guess I'm going to reacquaint myself with that situation and see if I can disable some or all of that incident report mailing system... I'm assuming this form along with many others will become a different kind of form and that `phpmailer` won't even be necessary? 

But that still doesn't explain why this class is being invoked at all in the first place during export... the views data export module doesn't use `phpmailer`??
