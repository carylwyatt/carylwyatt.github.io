### 22 jul 

To do this week:
- Finalize instruction form look/feel
- Continue intranet content migration
- Fix my docker container so I can test the LDAP plugin with the correct PHP modules

#### intranet

Rudaina and I continue our progress with migrating content to the intranet. 

I ran into yet another WP REST API interference with a plugin. I really don't want to try to diagnose this on appsdev as I'm assuming it's an outdated plugin or something similar that's blocking the API. I tested the same plugin on my localhost version with no problem, so it probably has something to do with version 5.1 of WP on PHP 5.5. The only other thing it could be is a setting in the UA theme. I find this highly unlikely because a) they have screenshots of using the Gutenberg editor, which also relies on the API being accessible, and b) they use lots of shortcodes, which are only available via Gutenberg. 

I also had success finding the list of drupal users and what roles everyone has. Now to decipher what these user roles have access to edit...

We also realized the sidebar menu wasn't displaying the children pages in the navigation. I looked into this briefly, and it looks like that behavior/functionality was commented out of the sidebar nav walker at some point. I've added this to my list of things to look into.

#### instruction form

I decided to spend a little bit of time seeing what of the instruction form I could clean up quickly. The instruction part looks much better, but I can't figure out a good way to alter the form itself without affecting the rest of the forms in libcal. I'm pretty annoyed right now because every other app in the springshare suite uses very specific ID numbers attached to content pieces, but these forms don't have their own IDs! The questions in the forms do, but the forms themselves do not. :expressionless: So figuring this out should be fun.
