### 16 sep

Happy Monday! 

When we last left our heroes, I had just pushed to production on a Friday. :laughing: It was an easy fix, so I didn't anticipate that anything would actually blow up, but I'm still glad it didn't blow up. 

**Today's goals (hopefully)**
- Computer software app icon upload issue
- Intranet custom post types

#### Custom post types

I'm reviewing a bit about WP custom post types, and I'm remembering now that I need to decide whether or not to make these custom post types a *plugin* or just add them to the theme itself. I think I'm going to go with a plugin just in case we decide to jump ship on this theme for whatever reason. It's better to be prepared and create modular/changeable functionality in case someone up the chain wants something else from the intranet, that way I don't have to re-code everything in a new theme down the road.

I'm creating a plugin for custom post types... now what? I need to decide what dictates each type of post (group blog, minutes) and what fields need to be available for these posts. I also need to think about whether these need custom taxonomies (my guess is yes).

Weird content types I need to decide what to do with:
- Groups
  - groups also need members, a homepage, posts, and minutes

### 17 sep

I spent most of yesterday researching, learning about, and pondering how to use custom post types and some other plugins in order to achieve the desired behavior for groups and their related content. Here's what I'm going to try today:

- Create a custom post type "Groups"
- Install *Advanced Custom Fields* plugin
- I believe the ACF plugin allows me to relate posts to other posts/pages

I'd really like to be able to have all the functionality of the groups directly in the Group interface, but that would require making a legit plugin, and ain't nobody got time for that. Maybe there's a plugin out there that does what I'm looking for?
