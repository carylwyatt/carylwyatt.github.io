### 24 jun

What will this week bring? Now that it's been confirmed we're pretty well in the clear for migrating our current site to a server with PHP 7.2 and upgrade to WP 5.2.2, I'm going to try to make sure everything I can test has been tested. Then I probably need to go back through my logs and files and see where I changed things. I didn't make any real changes to code... most of my issues were due to filepaths (which shouldn't change if we're just copying from one server to the other?) or apache settings (which Jennifer will handle with ease). 

Maybe today I can go back and forth between making sure those plugins are all upgradeable and php warnings are being handled and writing documentation?
