### 03 jun

Learned all the WordPress things! Since we've decided to focus on rewriting our apps as plugins for WP, I'm going to abandon the 5.5->7.2 testing for now. It might come in handy later, but if I'm going to move all (or most) of the apps to WordPress anyway, it doesn't make sense to spend the time figuring out whether or not they'll work on the new server if they won't even live there.

Friday and Monday were spent learning (or relearning in some cases) the WP template hierarchy, custom post types and taxonomies, plugins, and WP REST API. I'm pretty excited about the possibility of moving all of this under one umbrella, but I'll definitely need to take a look at what that means for all the data in the databases... can they be imported to a WP database that the plugin uses? Would the plugin then serve that data to the API? It's all kind of fuzzy right now, but I'm sure it will make more sense as I explore further.

I'd really like to keep going on my WP journey, but I need to spend a significant amount of time on LibCal and room displays today. Our room booking team has another meeting next week, and I'm not any closer to having the answers to the questions posed in the last meeting. 

My assignments from Tom:
- Exploration of LibCal functionality for making appointments with librarians
- Exploration of LibCal templating as a replacement for separate request form for instruction
- Exploration of LibCal ability/requirements to display schedules for individual group study rooms on the Meeting Minder displays (similar to displays on first floor)
- Exploration of LibCalâ€™s ability to handle library hours in general

Steven wants the study room displays to be the top priority here, so I think that's where I'll start today. Once I get that sufficiently nailed down (maybe a beta?), I can move on to ability ot handle hours in general, which I think will be trickier than I originally thought it would be.
