        		<h1>hi, i'm caryl</h1>
				<p>i'm a librarian. i'm a front-end developer. to sum up: i'm a community college reference and instruction librarian that also created and maintains the statewide library website. i've been having fun learning how to make our site student-friendly, which usually also means making my colleagues mad. (ha! change isn't fun.)</p>
