<h1>all about me</h1>
<p>I'm a librarian and a developer. More precisely, I'm a community college reference and instruction librarian who also created and maintains the statewide library website. I love both the teaching and creating aspects of my job, which is why I call myself a librarian|developer.</p>

	<h2>education</h2>
	<p>I graduated with a Master of Library and Information Science from <a href="http://ischool.sjsu.edu">San Jose State University iSchool</a> in 2015. Before that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in History from <a href="http://butler.edu">Butler University</a> in 2010. In between these degrees, I took a class in basic web coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP). I loved everything about it and continued learning on my own, with the help of countless YouTube videos, blog posts, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. When I felt like I needed more guided learning, I stepped up my game thanks to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>work</h2>
	<p>I've had the great pleasure of working at <a href="http://ivytech.edu">Ivy Tech Community College</a> since before I was officially a librarian. They took a chance on me when I had no library experience, and I've been fortunate to have the best colleagues to teach me everything there is to know about the library profession.</p>
	<p>I was originally hired as a part-time reference librarian and liaison to the business and computer science departments. After six months, I was promoted to full-time reference and instruction librarian and liaison to the health science and nursing departments. For the past two years, I've worked to increase communication and collaboration between the library and the nursing and health sciences department and have seen a significant increase in information literacy instruction sessions with both departments.</p>
	<p>Even though it's not listed in my job description, working with all of the library's tech tools is a major part of my job. I'm one of the few statewide admins for our LibGuides platform. Once I was admitted to the LibGuides task force, I started tinkering with moving our website from our old CMS to LibGuides CMS.</p>

	<h2>ePortfolio</h2>
	<p>Before graduating, I created an <a href="http://cwyatt.widgetwaretools.com/">ePortfolio</a> as my culminating experience at SJSU's iSchool. Take a look if you'd like!</p>
	<h2>personal</h2>
	<p>Once upon a time, Scott and I lived in New Zealand. You can check out photos and stories of our time there at our blog, <a href="https://wyattsinwellington.wordpress.com/">Wyatts in Wellington</a>.</p>
