<h2>UA Libraries website migration</h2>

<p>When google announced they were sunsetting AngularJS, it was time to choose a new framework. I had the opportunity to research Javascript frameworks and decided to try out Vue.js.</p>

<h2>research guide redesign</h2>

<p>During the summer of 2022, I worked with our Instructional Design Librarian to create a new, more user-friendly template for UA Libraries research guides.</p>

<p>To compare the older, cluttered template to the newer design, see the <a href="https://guides.lib.ua.edu/c.php?g=39560">Theater and Dance Guide</a> and the cleaner, streamlined <a href="https://guides.lib.ua.edu/anthropology/starthere">Anthropology Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>svelte occupancy counter</h2>

<p>When UA Libraries were set to reopen in Fall 2020 after being closed to the public due to COVID-19, the web team was assigned to create an app to track building occupancy in each of our library locations. In order to get the app up and running as quickly as possible, I chose to build it in Svelte, which is the easiest framework to get up and running with and also bundles down to a single vanilla javascript file. You can see all the details in the <a href="https://github.com/ualibweb/covid-counter">covid-counter repo</a>.</p>
